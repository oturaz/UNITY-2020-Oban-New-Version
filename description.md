# UNITY-2020-Oban-New-Version

Second attempt of creating a game after the show Oban: Star Racers, after a few years of more coding experience. Code on this one is a lot more clean

The goal was creating fluid movements using PID control systems, but I didn't like how unstable it felt so I abandoned it before I could implement any serious controls.

Controlling the ship feels really bad in this version; the PID is unstable. If anything, this project stands to display the evolution of my coding skills and how much more
clean it has become compared to my wast messy code. 

CONTROLS:
W,A,D
move mouse to move camera
